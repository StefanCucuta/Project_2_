**Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game**

Rock paper scissors lizard spock is an extension of the classic game of chance, rock paper scissors, created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla. Sam explains he created the expanded game because it seemed like most games of rock paper scissors with people you know would end in a tie.


***Game RULES***


"Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitate lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
